# About

I often get my mainstream news from memeorandum.com. When there's a need to learn more about a publication (ie NYT), I use mediabiasfactcheck.com to check where they skew ideologically, their history, factual accuracy and who they are funded by. This app scrapes daily news and media bias information, then cross references this data to user. It's a work in progress. As a user, you should be able to filter by factual reporting and credibility rating very soon!

This project is a prototype and will be archived and redone using a proper Node.js file structure, etc. It uses sqlite, without the use of any ORM. SQL is a wonderful technology. Writing raw queries was important to me for this project. Also, there was no need for a db type-system at this point. I've [researched](https://gist.github.com/guilsa/0cdd1258c46edf3112b2cc50af03fc8c) new node.js db tool options, but have punted on that for now. Would consider picking MySQL over PostgreSQL if the available db drivers have nicer and cleaner JS syntax ðŸ˜‹.

What's being used now:

- node/express
- better-sqlite3
- scrape-it
- node-cron
- create-react-app
- react
- odroid n2 (hardware)
- diet-pi (debian operating system)

# Prerequisites

- Node 16.11.0. I like to manage my Node versions with nvm.
- If you run any of the files that connect to the sqlite instance, it will create either `news-dev.db` or `news-prod.db` depending on the vars that's set. See Environment Variables section below for more info on that.
- Feel free to delete the db if you want to start from scratch.
  - You will then need to empty out [blacklist.txt](https://github.com/guilsa/news-scraper/blob/main/v1/blacklist.txt).
- To scrape/fetch news articles, [run the article scraper manually or start the cron job](https://github.com/guilsa/news-scraper/#scrapers).
- Deployment is done to a separate raspberry-pi style box.

# Install & start servers

Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
Then run everything concurrently: `npm run dev-watch`

# Scrapers:

See scraper directory. They can be initiated manually or via the cron job (only `/services/articles.mjs` for now).

## To run it manually:

Go in folder, then:

- Article scraper `node articles.mjs`
- Bias scraper `node bias.mjs`

## To run it as a job:

- `cd scraper && node cron.js`

# Querying the scraped news dataset:

Go in folder, then access db:

```
sqlite3 -readonly news.db
```

Changing output formats:

```
.mode column
.headers on
```

Example questions we can ask:

```
select count(*) from articles where source='New York Times';
select articles.title, articles.source, sources.bias_rating as bias_rating from articles left join sources on articles."source" = sources."name" where articles.title like lower('%woke%');
```

...which if you're curious, the result is:

```
title                                                     source      bias_rating

# Database Backup Scripts

- Export/import bash scripts are available, located in `/database/scripts`
- Export saves to the `/database/dump` folder

# Data QA & Challenges

`articles.mjs` is set up to retry on failed attempts and afterwards it will blacklist the url.

The wonderful folks at mediabiasfactcheck.com do not want you scraping their website as they have valuable information (if you want, consider supporting them!). They auto-scramble the html and therefore you should expect inconsistencies from the scraper's parsing logic. To circumvent this, check out [Database Backup Scripts](https://github.com/guilsa/news-scraper/#database-backup-scripts). That's my recommended workflow for cleaning up the media bias data - after exporting the db file, you will want to open it in your text editor of choice, make your batch edits, then use the import script to insert the data back.

# Deployment Workflow

Everything is set up to run on my local LAN, especially since I started this with sqlite.

- To continuously run all systems (cron job, backend and frontend servers), I use an odroid n2 single-board-computer running on a DietPi. I highly recommend using the DietPi for linux related learning (ie. self-hosting, dev-ops, etc).
- The machine runs headless (no monitor, boots directly to terminal) and is plugged directly into the router.
- The box is exposed to other computers in the LAN (local domain name resolution) using avahi-daemon.

# Environment Variables

PM2 is used with `production` environment variables set in `ecosystem.config.js`.

# PM2 Commands:

As opposed to restart, which kills and restarts the process, reload achieves a 0-second-downtime reload. To reload an app:

```
pm2 reload <app_name>
```

Logs:

```
# Display all apps logs in realtime
pm2 logs

#CLI dashboard:
pm2 monit
```

# Contributions

TBD. If you can, please support these and other projects by contributing what you can to honor their work:

- [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/)
- [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)

# Todo

- Make the express app simpler (shouldn't have used the express application generator)
- Add darkmode
- Add logging to cron job
- Add favorite column to sources (media bias) table
- Fix auto-increment from articles table (https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q1)
  - Articles are being displayed to the user out of order
- Allow users to filter by factual reporting and credibility rating
- Remove inline css
- Add updatedAt in sources table as well
- Migrate out out of sqlite
  - Consider [MySQL node.js drivers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30545749/how-to-provide-a-mysql-database-connection-in-single-file-in-nodejs) for their simplicity
  - Would unblock making it deployable to a PaaS (ie. Heroku, etc)

# Ideas

- Scrape articles and run google translate
- Extract keywords and key phrases using tensorflow (ie retext-keywords)
- Sentiment analysis (npm natural, python pattern)
- Cross-reference news article (or from a special keyword extraction of it) to youtube search results for that particular day
