# Todo

- Then add timestamp to articles scrape + table
  - Then partition off articles into sections for each day and ensure they are ordered

# Ideas

- infinite scroll
- daily cron
- saving to a database
- extract keywords and key phrases using tensorfloe (ie retext-keywords)
- sentiment analysis (npm natural, python pattern)
- use puppeteer as a blacklist prevention measure [1]
- cross-reference news article (or from a special keyword extraction of it) to youtube search results for that particular day
